<h3>These days <b>freedom</b> of speech is getting more and more repressed.</h3>
You can't say anything without receiving a blame from the society.
The once free Facebook, Instagram and other social networks are now under strict rules and guidance, with the goal of further indoctrinating the society.
The sport world is losing the most because of that.

About the creator:

**Hi! I am Alex Nikolov.**

I am 17 years old and I hate getting restricted from the freedoms I have by birth.
I am from Petrich, Bulgaria. I am learning Web Development in Software University.
This is my project I am going to defend on 16th of April. More of that, I plan to
actually make use of this forum by turning it into a place to freely discuss sports.

 Project was graded with 6.00/6.00 by the jury during my project defense. As sole and main problem was exposed the lack of complete error handling(it does nothing after entering an invalid route).
